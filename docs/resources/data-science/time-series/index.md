## Learning Paths

**Beginner Path**
1. Read *Forecasting: Principles and Practice* (free online)
2. Complete Kaggle's Time Series course
3. Practice with simple datasets (airline passengers, store sales)
4. Learn statsmodels for ARIMA
5. Try Prophet for business forecasting

**Intermediate Path**
1. Master classical methods (ARIMA, SARIMA, VAR)
2. Learn feature engineering with tsfresh
3. Explore ML methods with sktime
4. Study state space models
5. Practice on Kaggle competitions

**Advanced Path**
1. Deep learning with PyTorch Forecasting
2. Read recent papers (N-BEATS, TFT, Informer)
3. Implement custom models
4. Study probabilistic forecasting
5. Contribute to open-source libraries

## Practical Tips

- **Start Simple** - Master baseline models (naive, seasonal naive, moving average) before
complex methods.
- **Validate Properly** - Use time-based cross-validation, not random splits.
- **Domain Knowledge** - Understand your data's seasonality, trends, and business context.
- **Multiple Models** - Ensemble different approaches for better robustness.
- **Production Focus** - Consider inference speed, model size, and monitoring requirements.

## Community

- **Time Series Forecasting Forum**: [https://forecasters.org/](https://forecasters.org/)
- **r/MachineLearning - Time Series**: Reddit community for discussions.
- **Cross Validated - Stack Exchange**: Q&A for statistical questions.

**GitHub Topics**  
Follow `time-series` and `forecasting` topics.
