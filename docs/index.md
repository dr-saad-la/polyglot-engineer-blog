# Welcome to The Polyglot Engineer

Building production ML systems that actually work.

---

Most machine learning projects never make it to production. The gap between a working notebook and a system that runs reliably at scale is bigger than most people realize.

This blog is about closing that gap.

## What You'll Find Here

**Production ML Systems**  
How to take models from research to production. MLOps, deployment strategies, monitoring, and all the unglamorous parts that actually matter.

**Multi-Language Development**  
Real talk about when to use Python, when to reach for Rust, and why your production API probably shouldn't be a Jupyter notebook. Working across Python, Rust, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and R.

**Lessons from the Field**  
Seven years of building AI systems across agriculture, healthcare, and cybersecurity. What worked, what failed, and what I wish I'd known earlier.

**Practical Guides**  
Step-by-step tutorials on Docker for ML, Kubernetes deployments, FastAPI architectures, and production pipelines. No fluff, just what you need to ship systems.

## Why "Polyglot Engineer"?

Because production systems don't care about your favorite language. They care about reliability, performance, and maintainability.

Sometimes that means Python for rapid ML prototyping. Sometimes it's Rust for performance-critical paths. Sometimes it's TypeScript for robust APIs. The trick is knowing when to use what—and having the skills to make it work.

## Who This Is For

- ML engineers trying to figure out production deployment
- Data scientists tired of notebooks that never ship
- Software engineers moving into ML and wondering why everything breaks
- Anyone building systems that need to run 24/7, not just demo well

If you're in the messy middle ground between research and production, you're in the right place.
