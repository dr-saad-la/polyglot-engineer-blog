It is widely used for web development,\ndata science, and automation. Python's syntax is clean and readable.\n\nThe language was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Since then, it has grown\ninto one of the most popular programming languages in the world.\n\nPython has a large standard library. This makes it easy to accomplish common tasks\nwithout installing additional packages.\nEOF\n</code></pre>","tags":["uv","python","development","tools"]},{"location":"blog/2026-01-11-getting-started-with-uv%3A-build-a-text-processing-app/#run-analysis","title":"Run Analysis","text":"<pre><code># Full analysis\ntext-analyzer analyze sample.txt\n\n# Quick summary\ntext-analyzer summary sample.txt\n</code></pre> <p>Expected output:</p> <pre><code>\u250f\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2533\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2513\n\u2503 Metric               \u2503 Value \u2503\n\u2521\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2547\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2501\u2529\n\u2502 Words                \u2502 89    \u2502\n\u2502 Sentences            \u2502 8     \u2502\n\u2502 Paragraphs           \u2502 3     \u2502\n\u2502 Avg Word Length      \u2502 5.82  \u2502\n\u2502 Avg Sentence Length  \u2502 11.12 \u2502\n\u2502 Readability Score    \u2502 66.57 \u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n\nMost Common Words:\n  python: 5\n  language: 3\n  programming: 2\n  ...\n\n\u2713 Analysis complete!\n</code></pre> <p>Beautiful!</p>","tags":["uv","python","development","tools"]},{"location":"blog/2026-01-11-getting-started-with-uv%3A-build-a-text-processing-app/#adding-more-features","title":"Adding More Features","text":"<p>Want to extend this?

It's fast, modern, and fixes longstanding issues with pip and virtualenv.</p> <p>Start using UV if you: - Want faster development workflows - Need reliable dependency resolution - Prefer modern Python tooling - Work on teams (lock files matter) - Deploy to production (reproducibility matters)</p> <p>Stick with pip if you: - Have legacy systems that can't change - Need tools UV doesn't support yet - Prefer established, battle-tested tools</p> <p>For new projects, UV is the clear choice. For existing projects, migration takes 5-10 minutes and pays dividends immediately.</p> <p>The Python ecosystem is moving toward UV. Get ahead of the curve.</p> <p>Next Steps:</p> <ul> <li>Try the text analyzer example</li> <li>Migrate one project to UV</li> <li>Explore UV documentation</li> <li>Share your experience</li> </ul> <p>Questions?
